# Netflix_stock_visualizations_project

This is a Codecademy data visualizatoin capstone project that I completed. The premise is that fictional financial analysts at Yahoo Finance! would like some visualizations for a stock portfolio of Netflix. The primary aim of the project was just to make the visualizations, not to perform calculations or analyze anything other than the graphs produced.

I used Python 3.8 to complete this project, in addtion to Jupyter Notebook. Packages utilized include Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Codecademy provides the following reference for the data they provided: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DATA/. The website is a Yahoo Finance! website. Since I do not know if the data provided for the project is proprietary or not, I am not comfortable posting it in this repository; however, I will including a print-out of my Jupyter Notebook, so that you can see how my code ran and what it output. The schema of the provided data tables can be found in the Jupyter Notebook print-out.

I wrote a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation outlining the main results and conclusions of this project; I have included it as "Netflix_stock_2017_project.pdf." I should note that this PowerPoint presentation is much more verbose than what I would normally write, in light of the fact that it would be posted to the Web and not actually presented.

My Jupyter Notebook print-out is included as "netflix_visualizations_MAC.pdf"
